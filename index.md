## Research

In July 2023 I successfully defended my PhD thesis [_Machine-Readable Lives or ‘Troubled Families’? Classification, categorisation and stereotyping in data collection and sharing in children’s social care in England_](https://repository.essex.ac.uk/36627/). 

I carried out my research in the Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). 
My supervisors were [Professor Lorna McGregor](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/mcgre64903/lorna-mcgregor) and [Professor Roisin Ryan-Flood](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/ryanf84501/roisin-ryan-flood).

## Work history

From August 2022 to January 2024, I worked at the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/) as Senior Researcher, Public Sector Algorithm, where I led a research project investigating the experience of local authority staff using a data analytics system in a London borough. 

From 2011 to 2019, I worked at the International Secretariat of [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/), of which six years was spent in research and policy advice roles covering the rights of LGBTI people and of human rights defenders.

I have also worked as a caseworker for domestic violence and hate crime cases, a freelance maths tutor, a bartender, and an assistant language teacher for elementary and junior high school students in rural Wakayama, Japan.

I have an MA in Gender Studies from SOAS and a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.

## Open science 

I am an active contributor to the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) open-source book project, which aims to build open-source resources for reproducible, responsible and ethical data science, and a community to put these resources into practice. 
Guidance on how to join the community of contributors is in the [project repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

I was a mentor in two cohorts of [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/), mentoring the [HausaNLP](https://github.com/hausanlp) project leaders, who are building an open source community that promotes natural language processing work in the Hausa language, and a project developing data sharing frameworks in bioinformatics.  
In 2020, I was part of the second cohort of [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) Fellows: together with [Sophia Batchelor](https://twitter.com/brainonsilicon) and [Ismael Kherroubi Garcia](https://twitter.com/ismaelkhergar), I built a community of practice for the Turing Way's [Guide to Ethical Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research.html). 
This project built on work I did while based at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) in London as an Enrichment Student from January to September 2020.

## Board and advisory work

I'm a trustee of the [Feminist Review Trust](https://www.feminist-review-trust.com/), which allocates around GBP 25,000 to feminist projects worldwide annually. 
I also volunteered as a screener for the [EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community](https://europeanlesbianconference.org/)'s COVID-19 grants programme in September-October 2020, where we allocated EUR 28,000 to lesbian*-led groups in crisis across the region.

I was on the Steering Committee for the Software Sustainability Institute’s [Collaborations Workshop 2022](https://software.ac.uk/cw22), for which the themes were Code Review, Ethics, Hybrid Working and of course Software Sustainability. 

In 2020 and 2021, I was on the [DataKind UK](https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-uk) Ethics Committee: we ran ethics trainings for DataKind volunteers, supported DataCorps projects, and organised data ethics panel discussions and [book clubs](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/datakind-uk-4112514489) in London and online.

I was on the Steering Committee for the European Commission's [Transgender people in the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/lesbian-gay-bi-trans-and-intersex-equality/study-transgender-people-eu_en) study, which ran from 2018 to 2020.
The findings from the study, which covered the discrimination and harassment faced by trans people in the EU, and the impact of different legal gender recognition procedures on the lives of trans people, were published in the report [Legal gender recognition in the EU: the journeys of trans people towards full equality](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/lesbian-gay-bi-trans-and-intersex-equality/studies-and-research-lgbti-equality_en) in June 2020.

## Other projects

I have a [blog](https://seattleblog.lauracarter.net/) about living in Seattle.

I wrote a satirical twitter bot that gives [individual self-care advice](https://twitter.com/lifeadvicebot) for coping with structural problems.

I contributed to the Design Justice Network's zine #5, [How to make a local Design Justice node](https://designjustice.org/zines).

I ran [Data/Feminism](https://tinyletter.com/data-feminism), a weekly(ish) newsletter that looked at algorithms, data and technology from a feminist perspective. The [archives](https://tinyletter.com/data-feminism/archive) are online.

My tiny plot in a North London community garden had an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lauragardenn7/).
