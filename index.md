## About Me

Where something is going wrong for people, I want to find out why and how we can fix it.
I'm experienced in developing and leading research projects to find out what is going wrong for whom, why, and how to make changes that have an impact on people's lives. 
I've worked in the spaces where human rights, intersectional discrimination, new technologies and social justice interact. 
I write well-researched, rigorous and clear reports, for technical and non-technical audiences.

I will be a UC Berkeley Tech Policy Fellow in the [2024-25 cohort](https://citrispolicylab.org/2425tpf/). 
As part of the Improving Diversity in AI working group, I'll be researching how family relationships are represented in data and AI systems used in the public sector, and how these representations might reinforce stereotypes about 'normal' families. 

I recently relocated to the traditional land of the Duwamish people in Seattle, where I am writing a book proposal developing my PhD thesis research on data about people, and [writing about other things](https://blog.lauracarter.net/) as well. 

I'm also doing a bit of consulting: please do get in touch if you're in need of short-term research support!

## Work 

As a freelance researcher and evaluator, I've contracted for organisations including the World Bank, Edge Effect, Frontline AIDS, and DataAnnotation. 

From August 2022 to January 2024, I worked at the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/) as Senior Researcher, Public Sector Algorithm, where I led on [Critical Analytics?](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/local-authority-data-analytics/) a research project investigating the experience of local authority staff using a data analytics system in a London borough, which was published in June 2024.

I carried out my PhD research in the Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) from 2018 to 2023. 
My supervisors were [Professor Lorna McGregor](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/mcgre64903/lorna-mcgregor) and [Professor Roisin Ryan-Flood](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/ryanf84501/roisin-ryan-flood). During my PhD, I spent January-September 2020 as an Enrichment Student at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

From 2011 to 2019, I worked at the International Secretariat of [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/), of which six years was spent in research and policy advice roles covering the rights of LGBTI people and of human rights defenders.

I have also worked as a caseworker for domestic violence and hate crime cases, a freelance maths tutor, a bartender, and an assistant language teacher for elementary and junior high school students in rural Wakayama, Japan.

I have an MA in Gender Studies from SOAS and a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.

## Open science 

I have been a mentor in two cohorts of [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org)'s Open Seeds programme. 
I mentored the [HausaNLP](https://github.com/hausanlp) project leaders, who are building an open source community that promotes natural language processing work in the Hausa language, and a project developing data sharing frameworks in bioinformatics.

I was previously a Fellow in the second cohort of Open Seeds: together with [Sophia Batchelor](https://twitter.com/brainonsilicon) and [Ismael Kherroubi Garcia](https://twitter.com/ismaelkhergar), I built a community of practice for the Turing Way's [Guide to Ethical Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research.html). 
The Turing Way open-source book project aims to build open-source resources for reproducible, responsible and ethical data science, and a community to put these resources into practice. 
Guidance on how to join the community of contributors is in the [project repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Board and advisory work

Since 2017, I have been a trustee of the [Feminist Review Trust](https://www.feminist-review-trust.com/), which allocated around GBP 25,000 to feminist projects worldwide annually. The Trust is now in a winding-down phase and will close in 2024. 

I was on the Steering Committee for the Software Sustainability Institute’s [Collaborations Workshop 2022](https://software.ac.uk/cw22), for which the themes were Code Review, Ethics, Hybrid Working and of course Software Sustainability. 

In 2020 and 2021, I was on the [DataKind UK](https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-uk) Ethics Committee: we ran ethics trainings for DataKind volunteers, supported DataCorps projects, and organised data ethics panel discussions and [book clubs](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/datakind-uk-4112514489) in London and online.

I volunteered as a screener for the [EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community](https://europeanlesbianconference.org/)'s COVID-19 grants programme in September-October 2020, where we allocated EUR 28,000 to lesbian*-led groups in crisis across the region.

I was on the Steering Committee for the European Commission's [Transgender people in the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/lesbian-gay-bi-trans-and-intersex-equality/study-transgender-people-eu_en) study, which ran from 2018 to 2020.
The findings from the study, which covered the discrimination and harassment faced by trans people in the EU, and the impact of different legal gender recognition procedures on the lives of trans people, were published in the report [Legal gender recognition in the EU: the journeys of trans people towards full equality](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/lesbian-gay-bi-trans-and-intersex-equality/studies-and-research-lgbti-equality_en) in June 2020.

## Other projects

I have a [blog](https://seattleblog.lauracarter.net/) about living in Seattle.

I wrote a satirical twitter bot that gives [individual self-care advice](https://twitter.com/lifeadvicebot) for coping with structural problems.

I contributed to the Design Justice Network's zine #5, [How to make a local Design Justice node](https://designjustice.org/zines).

I ran [Data/Feminism](https://tinyletter.com/data-feminism), a weekly(ish) newsletter that looked at algorithms, data and technology from a feminist perspective. The [archives](https://tinyletter.com/data-feminism/archive) are online.

My tiny plot in a North London community garden had an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lauragardenn7/).
